# Topology Optimization for Metamaterials.
## (started on September 2020)
 This repository contains all the programs I will use for my iSURP project on Topology Optimization for Metamaterials.

- Using Finite Difference Method to numerically solve  u"(x) + f(x) = 0, where you will have to enter the function f: \
